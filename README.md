# Turing-Talk
A simple chat application that simulates conversation with another person. Inspired by the Turing test.

Built with HTML, CSS and JS (no frameworks) in response to a coding challenge to gain entry to Codeworks - a JS coding bootcamp in Barcelona.

A user can chat with "Alan Turing", who rather ironically attempts to satisfy the requirements of his own test, [the Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), which Wikipedia describes as : 

> The Turing test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. 

"Alan" can answer some commonly asked questions, tell jokes, interesting factoids and attempts to mimic human interaction.
